### Updated Personal Coding Portfolio

<a name="desc"></a>
## 1. Description

This is a personal portfolio to introduce myself to future employers or just to show others my work and give some information about myself.

The profile was designed for ease of use and responsiveness in mind. For the HTML, Bootstrap was utilized to help create the specific elements.

From there, modifications were made to better suit what I wanted to see. I then utilized CSS to make any creative adjustments I wanted to see

Technologies Used: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS
